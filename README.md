# URL Shortener

A simple URL shortener service that creates a short URL for a given long URL. This service uses only English alphabet letters (a-z, A-Z) and digits (0-9). When the user accesses the shortened URL, they are redirected to the original URL. Additionally, the service keeps track of the number of times a shortened URL has been accessed.  

## Features

- Generate short URLs for long URLs
